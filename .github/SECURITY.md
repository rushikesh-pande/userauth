## Security Best Practices in This Service

- **JWT Authentication**: All endpoints require valid JWT token
- **Rate Limiting**: 100 requests/minute per client (Bucket4j)
- **Input Validation**: All inputs validated with Bean Validation
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive fields encrypted at rest (Jasypt)
- **Audit Logging**: All transactions logged with correlation ID
- **Dependency Scanning**: Weekly OWASP NVD scans via GitHub Actions
- **Secret Management**: No secrets in code — use environment variables
